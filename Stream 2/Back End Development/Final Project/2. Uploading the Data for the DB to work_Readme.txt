• Run mongoDB by running the command mongod in your Terminal/Command Prompt.
• Leave the prompt running as it is and open another Terminal/Command Prompt window.
• Copy the csv file to the same location as the directory opened in the second terminal window.
• Enter the following command:

'mongoimport  -d avengers -c avengers_project --type csv --file avengers.csv --headerline'

• The database created: avengers
• The collection name: avengers_project
• The data type to be uploaded: csv 
• The filename: _csv_data\avengers.csv
• Treat the first record imported as the field names: --headerline

It will take a few minutes to upload the data. You will see a progress indicator in the terminal letting you know how much data has approximately been uploaded.
