No Challenge
============

 

This lesson didn’t contain a challenge. It did go over the basics of setting a
breakpoint in the Pycharm IDE, debugging the code, and stepping through it to
check the output as the program runs.

 

The code is the same as the first lesson (Installing Pycharm), however, we have
slightly modified it this time, to fix the bug from the first lesson. We needed
to convert the user input to an int from a string.

 

The modified line:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
guess = int(raw_input('guess the number: '))
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 

The program now works as expected. You should also note that the number index
counts from 0 - 9 not 1 - 10, so if you think you have found another bug because
you have tried every guess and still have not won, this is more than likely the
reason.
