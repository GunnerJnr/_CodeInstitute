CHALLENGE
=========

 

-   Change RANGE and NUMBER\_OF\_GUESSES to something else.

-   It would be better if the user knew what range the number is within. Modify
    the program at line 22 so that it tells the user what the range is, by using
    the RANGE variable.

-   We could also tell the user how many guesses they’ve got left. Modify the
    program again to first work out how many guesses are left, then tell the
    user.

-   Change the program so that the range can be anything, i.e. it doesn’t always
    start at 0.

-   Notice what happens when you type in a word, not a number. We will explore
    this further when we get to File IO and Exceptions, where you will learn how
    to handle errors like this in a more elegant manner.
